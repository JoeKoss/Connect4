# Connect4
A connect 4 game I made for a school project. Coded in python, runs on the command line.

When running the program, the game will immediately begin.
If you wish to view help about the game, you can type "help" when running the program: python connect4.py help
If you wish to exit the game at any time, you may type "exit" or "quit"
